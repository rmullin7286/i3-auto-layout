# i3-auto-layout (Ryan's fork)
Automatic, optimal tiling for i3wm inspired by the deprecated `i3-alternating-layouts` and bspwm. An appropriate split is set for each window based on its geometry. 

Improvements over `i3-alternating-layouts`:
- single compiled binary with no dependencies (except i3 of course)
- written in Rust for maximum performance and low resource usage (~0% CPU, ~0% MEM)
- works asynchronously over IPC
